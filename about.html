                            <p>
                                Dev Patel is currently a junior at the Indiana University&hyphen;Bloomington, where he
                                is currently studying Data Science. He is a first-generation college student,
                                and he takes great pride in pursuing a higher education and building a future
                                that reflects both his personal goals and his family's sacrifices.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the beginning of his life journey, it has been shaped by a unique cultural
                                background, being that he spent his early childhood in India before his family
                                moved to the United States when he was at the age of eleven. By growing up in
                                two different environments, this allowed Dev to experience diverse perspectives,
                                but it presented a challenge of adapting to a new language and a different
                                life-style.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One of the most meaningful obstacles Dev overcame was the language barrier he faced after
                                relocating to the United States. Yet, through dedication and persistence, he did not only
                                adapt successfully but also went on to learn and speak up to three other languages. His
                                accomplishment and determination reflects his dependable and goal-oriented personality, as
                                well as his ability to connect with people from many different backgrounds.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Dev credits much of his daily motivation to his parents, who made significant life changes
                                to provide greater opportunities for him and his family.Outside of academics, Dev enjoys
                                spending his free time playing video games with friends and engaging in motorsport-related hobbies.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                He has a strong passion for cars and racing, which has grown over the years through friendships
                                and personal interest, including time spent using a racing simulator. Dev is also committed to
                                staying active and frequently goes to the gym.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Looking ahead, Dev is focused on securing a summer internship in a data science-related
                                field and hopes to begin his career as a data scientist or analyst after graduation.

                                        Growing up in both India and the United States, it has shaped Dev's adaptable and
                                        open-minded outlook. Overcoming early language barriers led him to become fluent in
                                        three languages. This multicultural experience allows him to connect with people from
                                        diverse backgrounds and understand different perspectives.
